# COMPSCI 235 Lab Report 4
### Stanley Wu
## Notes
1. Importing Flask:
- ```from flask inport flask```
- ```app = Flask(__name__)```
- ```@app.route("/")```
- ```<function>```
- ```if __name__ == __main__:```
  - ``` app.run(debug=True, port=8000)```

2. Managing directories for security reasons: Project[static{css(styles.css)}, templates{index.html}, main.py, .gitignore]

3. Texts in `{{}}` are rendered as variables in HTML file.

## Reflection

I have followed the Flask structure to create folders that include my HTML, CSS and Flask.
I have also learned to add new routes to the app.

- HTML tags are used to contain elements and tells the browser how to format the webpage

Question 2.
Why do we want to enable debug mode during development?

- There are 6 levels from H1 to H6

Question 3.
If you put a python file under `./static/` directory, can you access it from 
the browser?

- No

Question 4.
What is URL encoding and why does it exist?

- It converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.

- It exists as URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. Since URLs often contain characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted into a valid ASCII format.
