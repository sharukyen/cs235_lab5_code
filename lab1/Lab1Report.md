# COMPSCI 235 Lab Report 1
### Stanley Wu
## Notes

1. For software versioning the numbers represent different scales of update
- For example 3.9.13 represents major update 3, minor update 9 and patch 13
2. For servers without graphic UI, the terminal is very important
- To navigate the home directory ```cd ~``` can be used
- To create a folder named workspace ```mkdir workspace``` can be used
- To rename or move files the command ```mv``` can be used
- To remove a folder ```rm``` can be used
3. Having a virtual environment dedicated to each project is important as different versions are incompatible so you can work on it later.

## Reflection

I have learnt basic terminal commands to navigate folders and also the mark down language.
Also I have understood the significance of IDE's and Virtual environments.
In this lab I have practiced using breakpoints to debug code.

## Solutions

Question 1.
- The probability of winning is 1 in 100 or 1%.

Question 2.
- Yes, by inserting the breakpoint at line 50 and debugging you can see the number guessed by the computer.

- ```guess = user_guess(selected_number)```

Question 3.
- Yes, by changing the computer generated value to 42.
